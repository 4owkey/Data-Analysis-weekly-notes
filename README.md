 DAY 1

  WHAT IS DATA ANALYSIS?

    - Analytics is at the heart of modern business.
    - Virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offerings. Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability of their work.
    - The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization.
    - This involves several key responsibilities and skills.
    
    1. Data Collection and Preparation:
       - Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
       - Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
         
    2. Data Analysis:
       - Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
       - Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

    3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
       - Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
       - Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,

    4. Decision Support:
       - Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
       - Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

    5. Collaboration and Communication:
       - Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
       - Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,
      
    6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:
       - Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
       - Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

    - By fulfilling these roles, a data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies, drive business strategies, and create a competitive advantage.
    - The goal is to contribute to the organization's success by turning data into a valuable asset that informs and drives decision-making.
    - Data analysts are the professionals who possess the skills and knowledge required to perform this vital work.
    - They understand how the organization can acquire, clean, and transform data to meet the organization's needs.
    - They are able to take that collected information and analyze it using the techniques of statistics and machine learning.
    - They may then create powerful visualizations that display this data to business leaders, managers, and other stakeholders.

  THE ANALYTICS PROCESS

    - The process they move through as they acquire new data, clean and manipulate that data, analyze it, create visualizations, and then report and communicate their results to business leaders.

   THE ANALYTICS PROCESS IS ITERATIVE

    - While we describe the steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions, it is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.
    - For example, an analyst reviewing a visualization may notice unusual data points that do not seem to belong in the dataset, causing them to return to the data cleaning stage and rerun their analysis with the newly cleaned dataset.
    - Similarly, an analyst running an analysis might discover that their analysis would be enriched by adding another source of data, causing them to return to the data acquisition stage.

   ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES

    - Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
    
    - Major categories of analytics techniques.
      * Descriptive Analytics
      * Predictive Analytics
      * Prescriptive Analytics

   MACHINE LEARNING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DEEP LEARNING

    - The work of analytics is intellectually and computationally demanding. Fortunately, you do not always have to do this work yourself; you can rely on automated techniques to help you unlock the hidden value in your data.
    - Machine learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future.

   SOME COMMON CASES WHERE MACHINE LEARNING COMMONLY ADDS VALUE

      * Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.
      * Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident.
      * Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.
      * Recommending the next movie that a customer might wish to watch based on their past activity and the preferences of similar customers.
      * Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advance based on forecasted demand,

      - Machine learning can bring value to almost every field where discovering previously unknown knowledge is usefulâ€”and we challenge you to think of a field where knowledge doesn't offer an advantage!
      
      - Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior.
      
      - Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques.
      - ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge.
      - Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.
      
      - Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way.
      
      - It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.
  
   DATA GOVERNANCE

     - We discussed the three major forces that have come together to create the Golden Age of Analytics: data, storage, and computing.
     - Without strong governance, analytics programs cannot function effectively.
     - Data governance programs ensure that the organization has high-quality data and is able to effectively control that data.

   ANALYTICS TOOLS

     - Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process.
     - These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data.
